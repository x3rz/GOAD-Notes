It is more likely that an organization has already been compromised and has'nt discovered yet.

**Current focus on 3 of them:**
- Red Teaming
- Insider Attack Simulation
- Blue Teaming


> Current scenario is that you have given a breached machine and you have to perform the lateral movement if other network is avaible other with gain the higher privileges.


In this we follow the **Insider attack simulation** in which we already have the machine means we dont need to perform the **Recon** part as it has been done perviously already.

*In this we have already done the Recon part.*


**Our final goal is *Persistance and Data Exfiltration***
