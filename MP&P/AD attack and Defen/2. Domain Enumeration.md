### OU (Organizational Unit)
Smallest unit in the Active Directory system conatins users, groups, and computers, and they exist within a domain ==OUs are useful when an administrator wants to deploy Group Policy to a subset of users,groups and computers within domain OUs also Administrator to deligate admin tasks users/groups without having to make him/her an administrator of the dictory.==

- Get all the OUs 
```powershell
Get-NetOU

Get-NetOU | select name
```

### ACL (Important) 
Access Control List is a list of access control entries (ACE). Each ACE in an ACl identifies a trustee and specifies the access right allowed, denied, or audited for the trustee.

The security descriptor for a securable object can contain two types of ACLs: a DACL and a SACL.

-   DACL(Discretionary access control list): Defines the permissions trustees (a user or group) have on an object.
-   SACL(System access control list): Logs success and failure audit messages when an object is accessed.
	- **This is very important for attacker as they logs juicy information.**
-   the ACL is like asking: who has permission and what can be done on an object?
-   Most of the system administrators are wrongly configuring the ACL (such as granting a normal user to important permissions). So as attackers, we are interested in enumerating the ACL in order to find interesting ACLs!


- Enumerate the ACLs for the users groups

```powershell
Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName "users" -ResolveGUIDs
```

- See if user has rights to modify rights to a GPO

```powershell
Get-NeyGPO | %{Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs -Name $_.Name}
```

- Get the ACLs associated with the specified object
```powershell
Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName student1 -ResolveGUIDs
```

- Get the ACLs associatedd with the specifed prefix to be used for search
```powershell
Get-ObjectAcl -ADSprefix 'CN=Administrator,CN=Users' -Verbose
```

- Get the ACLs associated with the specified LDAP path to be used for search

```powershell
Get-ObjectAcl -ADSpath "LDAP://CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=dollarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs -Verbose
```

- Get the ACLs associated with the specified path

```powershell
Get-PathAcl -Path "\\dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local\sysvol"
```
- **Intersting ACE**

```powershell
Invoke-ACLScanner -ResolveGUIDs
```

- ACL associated with specific account

```powershell
Get-DomainObjectAcl -Identity <user> -ResolveGUIDs
```

- Get associated with the specific path

```powershell
Get-PathAcl -Path "\\10.0.0.2\users"
```

- Check for modify rights/permissions for the user group

```powershell
Invoke-ACLScanner -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReference -match "user"}
```

- Check for modify rights/permissions for the RDPUsers group

```powershell
Invoke-ACLScanner -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReference -match "RDPusers"}
```


### Trusts

There are two type of trusts:
1. One-Way Trust : Direction of access is reverse of Direction of Trust
2. Two-Way Trust : Bi Directional Trust 


**Trust TRANSITIVITY**

1. Transitive:
	1. Bi Directional Trust
		- a=b=c; a=b,a=c
2. Non Transitive:
	1. One way or Two way trust 
		- Cannot be extend in other domain in the forest.
		- This is default trust (called external trust) between two domains in different forest when forest do not have a true relationship

Further Types of Domain Trusts:

1. Default / Automatic Trusts
	1. Parent-Child trust : Ex. x3rz.cyberlix.local is child of cyberlix.local
		- Trust is always two way Trasitive.
	2. Tree-Root Trust : When new domain tree is added to a forest root.
		- Two way Teansitive.
	3. Shortcut Trust : Used to reduce the access time in complex trust scenarios.
		- Can be One way or Two way Transitive.
	4. External Trust : Between Two domains in different forest when forest do not have a trust relationship.
		- Can be One or Two way Non-Transtive.
	5. Forest Trust : Trust between forest root domain.
		- cannot be extend to a third forest
		- can be one or two way and transitive or non-transitive.

### User hunting
```powershell
# Find all machines on the current domain where the current user has local admin access
Find-LocalAdminAccess -Verbose
# Find local admins on all machines of the domain
Find-DomainLocalGroupMember -Verbose
# Enumerates the local group memberships for all reachable machines the <domain>
Find-DomainLocalGroupMember -Domain <domain>
# Looks for machines where a domain administrator is logged on
Invoke-UserHunter                                                 
# Confirm access to the machine as an administrator
Invoke-UserHunter -CheckAccess   

# Find computers where a domain admin ( or specified user/group) has sessions:
Invoke-UserHunter -GroupName "RDPUsers"

# Find computers where a domain admin is logged-in
Invoke-UserHunter -Stealth

```
