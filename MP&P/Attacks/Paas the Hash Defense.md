Hard to make it difficult but could make more difficult for attacker

- Limit account re-use:
	- Avoid re-using local admin password
	- Disable and Administrator accounts
	- Limit who is a local administrator (least privilege)
- Utilize strong passwords:
	- The longer the better 
	- Avoid using common words
	- I like long sentences
- Privilege Access Management (PAM)
	- Check out/in sensitive accounts when needed
	- Automatically rotate passwords and check out and check in
	- Limits pass attacks as hash/password is strong and constantly rotated
