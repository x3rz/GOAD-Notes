Use an EICAR file, a benign test file for testing AV detection and verify it gets detected by AV scanners on VirusTotal.

-   Checksum the EICAR file
-   Perform a normal file upload
-   Download the EICAR file
-   Checksum the EICAR file and validate itâ€™s the same file

Repeat the same test 24 hours later and assess if any daily antivirus filtering is taking place.
