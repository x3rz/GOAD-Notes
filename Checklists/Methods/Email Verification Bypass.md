1. Sing up on the web application as attacker@mail.com
2. You will receive a confirmation email on attacker@mail.com, do not open that link now.
3. The application may ask for confirming your email, check if it allows navigating to account settings page.
4. On settings page check if you can change the email.
5. If allowed, change the email to victim@mail.com.
6. Now you will be asked to confirm victim@mail.com by opening the confirmation link received on victim@mail.com, insted of opening the new link go to attacker@mail.com inbox and open the previous received link.
7. If the application verifies vitim@mail.com by using perivious verification link received on attacker mail, then this is a email verification bypass.
