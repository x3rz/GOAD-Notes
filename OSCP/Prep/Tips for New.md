1. Brush up on AD skills. This was an easy 40 pointer. 
2. Use autorecon and nmap. Some things showed up in autorecon which were not picked up by nmap. 
3. Make sure you have the impacket toolkit. This was a life saver for me. 
4. While setting up netcat listener, use one of the ports which were open in the nmap scan (most preferably the common ports). This will help incase if any firewall is enabled 
5. Finally follow the KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) prinicple. I spent hours doing complex stuff for 6 hours straight when I could have finished it in 5 minutes
