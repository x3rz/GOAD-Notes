Open System Interconnection

1. Application
2. Presentation
3. Session
4. Transport
5. Network
6. Data Link
7. Physical

**Application**:
> accepts communication requests from applications


**Presentation** (translation of data into a standardised format,handling any enryption,compression or other transformations of the data.)
**Session** (can we set up a connection with the other computer across the network.If we can then job is to maintain it,syncronise the connections maintains the connection so that data dont get mixed up(see the two tabs of browser))
>tracks communication between the host and reciving comp


**Transport** (Transport layer header - which adds tcp or udp in the packet for connection type)
**Network**(adds the ip into the packet)
**Datalink**(physical addressing transmission i.e MAC adds into the packet)
> packets are not corrupted
> Data formatted in prep for transmission
> 

**Physical**(electrical pulses to binary data and visa versa)
> layer transmits and receives data.
