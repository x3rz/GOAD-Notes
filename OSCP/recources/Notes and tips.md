1.  Practice OSCP like Vulnhub VMs for the first 30 days
2.  Buy HackTheBox VIP & Offsec Proving Grounds subscription for one month and practice the next 30 days there. Recently, I hear a lot of people saying that proving grounds has more OSCP like VMs than any other source.
3.  Finally, buy a 30 days lab voucher and pwn as many machines as possible.
