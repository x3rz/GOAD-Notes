I enjoy learning new things and applying what I've learned to help safeguard and contribute to the infosec community. I am a great candidate for this internship because I work hard to exceed my levels and am constantly searching for opportunities to add to my skill levels. I am in 3rd sem pursuing  BTech in Computer Science with Specialization in Cyber Security. I'm presently working with the open-source community "vulnfreak" as a CTF team leader, where I oversee the CTF team, create CTF challenges, and as an infosec writer, and I've previously organized HackFest2020. I'm also working on numerous open-source projects. OSINT, VAPT, Red Teaming, CTFs, Digital Forensics, and Bug Bounty are some of my favorite topics, and they are where I spend most of my time. I play CTFs, KOTH, and Battlegrounds on a regular basis to keep my skills sharp and learn new things. Last year, I had an internship in Safe Security, where I performed quality assurance evaluations on projects to verify quality, consistency, and to detect and document gaps. I'm now studying for pentest+ and aspire to be a Red Teamer.
